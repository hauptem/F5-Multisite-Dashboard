These are pre-minified and tested CSS and Javascript files. 

It is recommended to use the minified versions in a production environment in order to reduce iFile 
size as much as possible with the caveat that debug capability will no longer exist. Use the non-minified 
versions for instances where debug is required. Note that iRule debug will always work as long as the debug 
datagroup and variable are set.
