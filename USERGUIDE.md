## Advanced Search and Filtering

### Search Input Field

- **Location**: Central search box in the top controls
- **Placeholder**: "Search... BOOLEAN OR (default), AND, NOT..."
- **Real-Time**: Results update as you type (300ms delay)
- **Quick Buttons**: "Changed" and "Clear" buttons for common filters

### Boolean Search Operators

#### Basic Search (OR Logic - Default)

- `web database` â†’ Shows pools containing "web" or "database"
- `192.168.10 10.20.1` â†’ Shows pools with "192.168.10" or "10.20.1" IP addresses

#### AND - All terms must match

- `centos AND app01` â†’ Pools with "centos" members and "app01" in pool name
- `web AND 192.168` â†’ Pools with "web" and "192.168" IP addresses

#### NOT - Exclude terms

- `NOT down` â†’ All pools except those with "down" members
- `windows NOT disabled` â†’ Pools with "windows" but not "disabled" members
- `NOT down AND Cisco` â†’ Pools with "Cisco" but no "down" members

#### Special Keywords

- **changed - Find Alarms**
- `changed` â†’ Only pools with pulsing status badges (unacknowledged state changes)

### Search Examples

- `"web server" AND up` â†’ Pools with exact phrase "web server" and "up" status
- `centos AND changed NOT disabled` â†’ Changed centos servers (not disabled)
- `up NOT down` â†’ Show pools that are fully available
- `down NOT up` â†’ Show pools that are fully unavailable

### Search Capabilities

The search function examines:

- Pool names and alias names
- Pool status (UP, DOWN, DISABLED, UNKNOWN, EMPTY)
- Member IP addresses and hostnames
- Member ports and status
- Case-insensitive matching with partial word support

## Pool Reordering

### Enabling Reorder Mode

1. Click the "Reorder" button in the top-left of the controls bar
2. Button changes to "Disable" and highlights in yellow
3. Pool tables become draggable with move cursors

### Reordering Pools

1. **Drag Source**: Click and hold on any pool table
2. **Visual Feedback**: Dragged pool becomes semi-transparent and slightly smaller
3. **Drop Target**: Drag over another pool table (highlights with dashed border)
4. **Complete**: Release to swap positions

### Reorder Behavior

- **Swap Logic**: Dragging Pool A onto Pool B swaps their positions
- **Persistence**: New order is automatically saved and persists for session duration only
- **Site-Specific**: Each site maintains its own custom pool order
- **Fallback**: If no custom order exists, pools use their configured sort order or, if no sort order was configured, the pools will display in the order they are listed in the pools datagroup

## Status Change Tracking

### Overview

The dashboard tracks when pool member statuses change from their baseline state and provides visual indicators when member states change.

### Visual Change Indicators

#### Pulsing Animation

- **Effect**: Status badges pulse with a golden glow
- **Trigger**: When a member's status differs from its established baseline
- **Duration**: Continues until manually acknowledged

#### Clickable Status Badges

- **Appearance**: Changed status badges become clickable (cursor changes to pointer)
- **Border**: Border indicates acknowledgment is available
- **Tooltip**: Enhanced tooltip shows previous status and change time

### Baseline Status Concept

- **Initial State**: When first seen, a member's polled status becomes its "baseline"
- **Change Detection**: Any deviation from the recorded baseline triggers change tracking
- **Auto-Return**: If status returns to recorded baseline, change indicator automatically clears

### Acknowledging Changes

- **Identify Changed Member**: Look for pulsing status badges
- **Click Status Badge**: Single click on the pulsing badge
- **Immediate Effect**: Pulsing stops, badge returns to normal appearance
- **New Baseline**: Current status becomes the new baseline for future comparisons

### MICRO View Alarm Logic

In MICRO view mode:

- **Pool-Level Alarms**: Entire pool status badge shows alarm state if any member has unacknowledged changes
- **Tooltip Enhancement**: Pool tooltips indicate "Members need attention - switch to MACRO Mode"
- **Quick Identification**: Easily spot pools with issues across large deployments

## DNS Integration and Optimization

### DNS Hostname Display

- **Automatic Resolution**: Backend resolves IP addresses to hostnames when configured
- **Display Priority**: Shows hostname:port when available, otherwise IP:port
- **Caching**: Intelligent client-side caching reduces backend DNS lookups
- **Tooltip Support**: Hover over hostnames to see underlying IP addresses

### DNS Management Functions

#### Resolve DNS

- **Function**: Forces fresh DNS resolution for all current pool members
- **Use Case**: Update hostnames after DNS changes
- **Button Location**: "Resolve" button in bottom bar
- **Optimization**: Only resolves IPs not already cached with valid hostnames

#### Flush DNS Cache

- **Function**: Clears all cached DNS entries for current site
- **Effect**: Immediate UI update showing IP addresses instead of hostnames
- **Use Case**: Clear stale DNS cache entries
- **Button Location**: "Flush" button in bottom bar

## FAQ

**Q: How often does the dashboard refresh data?**

The default refresh interval is 30 seconds, but you can change it to 10, 60, or 90 seconds using the dropdown next to the countdown timer or by pressing Alt+P to cycle through options.

**Q: What's the difference between MACRO and MICRO view modes?**

MACRO view shows detailed member information for troubleshooting. MICRO view shows pool-level summaries for monitoring many pools at once. MICRO view displays pool-level alarms when any member has unacknowledged status changes.

**Q: Can I monitor multiple sites simultaneously?**

Yes, the dashboard supports multi-instance operation as of version 1.6.

**Q: What's the difference between pool names and aliases?**

Pool names are the actual F5 LTM identifiers. Aliases are user-friendly names configured for easier identification. Use Alt+A to toggle between displaying actual names and aliases.

**Q: How do I search for pools with any DOWN members?**

Type "down" in the search box. This will show pools that either have DOWN status themselves or contain members with DOWN status.

**Q: How do I find pools that need attention?**

Type "changed" in the search box, click the "Changed" button, or press Alt+C. This shows pools with unacknowledged status changes (pulsing badges).

**Q: What's the difference between "web app" and "web AND app" in search?**

"web app" (without quotes) searches for pools containing "web" OR "app". "web AND app" requires both terms to be present. Use quotes for exact phrases: "web app".

**Q: Why are some status badges pulsing?**

Pulsing indicates that a pool member's status has changed from its initially recorded baseline state. Click the pulsing badge to acknowledge the change and stop the pulsing.

**Q: What happens if I don't acknowledge status changes?**

The pulsing will continue until you either click to acknowledge, use the "Reset" button, or the member returns to its baseline state automatically.

**Q: Can I see a history of status changes?**

Yes, enable the logger (Alt+L) to see real-time status changes with timestamps. The logger maintains a history of changes for your current session. 5000 event FIFO buffer.

**Q: Why do some pools show hostnames and others show IP addresses?**

The dashboard uses DNS resolution when configured. If a hostname can be resolved for a pool member, it displays the hostname. Otherwise, it shows the IP address. You can hover over hostnames to see the underlying IP address.

**Q: How do I update hostnames after DNS changes?**

Press Alt+R or click the "Resolve" button to force fresh DNS resolution. Press Alt+F or click "Flush" to clear the DNS cache completely.

**Q: How much data does the dashboard use?**

Data usage is minimal. Each refresh fetches only JSON data (typically just a few KB per site). The amount depends on the number of pools and members configured for the site you are monitoring.

**Q: Is there a maximum number of pools the dashboard can display?**

There's no hard limit, but performance may decrease with very large numbers of pools (1000+). Use search filtering and MICRO view to manage large pool sets effectively. Dashboard 1.x has been tested with 600 pools and 800+ nodes on a Lab license VE without issue.
