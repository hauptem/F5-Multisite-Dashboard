## Advanced Search and Filtering

### Search Input Field

- **Location**: Central search box in the top controls
- **Placeholder**: "Search... BOOLEAN OR (default), AND, NOT..."
- **Real-Time**: Results update as you type (300ms delay)
- **Quick Buttons**: "Changed" and "Clear" buttons for common filters

### Boolean Search Operators

#### Basic Search (OR Logic - Default)

- `web database` â†’ Shows pools containing "web" or "database"
- `192.168.10 10.20.1` â†’ Shows pools with "192.168.10" or "10.20.1" IP addresses

#### AND - All terms must match

- `centos AND app01` â†’ Pools with "centos" members and "app01" in pool name
- `web AND 192.168` â†’ Pools with "web" and "192.168" IP addresses

#### NOT - Exclude terms

- `NOT down` â†’ All pools except those with "down" members
- `windows NOT disabled` â†’ Pools with "windows" but not "disabled" members
- `NOT down AND Cisco` â†’ Pools with "Cisco" but no "down" members

#### Special Keywords

- **changed - Find Alarms**
  - `changed` â†’ Only pools with pulsing status badges (unacknowledged state changes)

### Advanced Search Examples

- `"web server" AND up` â†’ Pools with exact phrase "web server" and "up" status
- `centos AND changed NOT disabled` â†’ Changed centos servers (not disabled)
- `up NOT down` â†’ Show pools that are fully available
- `down NOT up` â†’ Show pools that are fully unavailable

### Search Capabilities

The search function examines:

- Pool names and alias names
- Pool status (UP, DOWN, DISABLED, UNKNOWN, EMPTY)
- Member IP addresses and hostnames
- Member ports and status
- Case-insensitive matching with partial word support

## Pool Reordering

### Enabling Reorder Mode

1. Click the "Reorder" button in the top-left of the controls bar
2. Button changes to "Disable" and highlights in yellow
3. Pool tables become draggable with move cursors

### Reordering Pools

1. **Drag Source**: Click and hold on any pool table
2. **Visual Feedback**: Dragged pool becomes semi-transparent and slightly smaller
3. **Drop Target**: Drag over another pool table (highlights with dashed border)
4. **Complete**: Release to swap positions

### Reorder Behavior

- **Swap Logic**: Dragging Pool A onto Pool B swaps their positions
- **Persistence**: New order is automatically saved and persists across sessions
- **Site-Specific**: Each site maintains its own custom pool order
- **Fallback**: If no custom order exists, pools use their configured sort order

## Status Change Tracking

### Overview

The dashboard tracks when pool member statuses change from their baseline state and provides visual indicators when member states change.

### Visual Change Indicators

#### Pulsing Animation

- **Effect**: Status badges pulse with a golden glow
- **Trigger**: When a member's status differs from its established baseline
- **Duration**: Continues until manually acknowledged

#### Clickable Status Badges

- **Appearance**: Changed status badges become clickable (cursor changes to pointer)
- **Border**: Border indicates acknowledgment is available
- **Tooltip**: Enhanced tooltip shows previous status and change time

### Baseline Status Concept

- **Initial State**: When first seen, a member's polled status becomes its "baseline"
- **Change Detection**: Any deviation from the recorded baseline triggers change tracking
- **Auto-Return**: If status returns to recorded baseline, change indicator automatically clears

### Acknowledging Changes

- **Identify Changed Member**: Look for pulsing status badges
- **Click Status Badge**: Single click on the pulsing badge
- **Immediate Effect**: Pulsing stops, badge returns to normal appearance
- **New Baseline**: Current status becomes the new baseline for future comparisons

### MICRO View Alarm Logic

In MICRO view mode:

- **Pool-Level Alarms**: Entire pool status badge shows alarm state if any member has unacknowledged changes
- **Tooltip Enhancement**: Pool tooltips indicate "Members need attention - switch to MACRO Mode"
- **Quick Identification**: Easily spot pools with issues across large deployments

## DNS Integration and Optimization

### DNS Hostname Display

- **Automatic Resolution**: Backend resolves IP addresses to hostnames when configured
- **Display Priority**: Shows hostname:port when available, otherwise IP:port
- **Caching**: Intelligent client-side caching reduces backend DNS lookups
- **Tooltip Support**: Hover over hostnames to see underlying IP addresses

### DNS Management Functions

#### Resolve DNS (Alt+R)

- **Function**: Forces fresh DNS resolution for all current pool members
- **Use Case**: Update hostnames after DNS changes
- **Button Location**: "Resolve" button in bottom bar
- **Optimization**: Only resolves IPs not already cached with valid hostnames

#### Flush DNS Cache (Alt+F)

- **Function**: Clears all cached DNS entries for current site
- **Effect**: Immediate UI update showing IP addresses instead of hostnames
- **Use Case**: Clear stale DNS cache entries
- **Button Location**: "Flush" button in bottom bar

## FAQ

### General Usage

**Q: How often does the dashboard refresh data?**

The default refresh interval is 30 seconds, but you can change it to 10, 60, or 90 seconds using the dropdown next to the countdown timer or by pressing Alt+P to cycle through options.

**Q: What's the difference between MACRO and MICRO view modes?**

MACRO view shows detailed member information for troubleshooting. MICRO view shows pool-level summaries for monitoring many pools at once. MICRO view displays pool-level alarms when any member has unacknowledged status changes.

**Q: Can I monitor multiple sites simultaneously?**

No, the dashboard displays one site at a time. Use the site selector to switch between sites. Each site maintains its own settings, view mode, and pool order.

**Q: What's the difference between pool names and aliases?**

Pool names are the actual F5 LTM identifiers. Aliases are user-friendly names configured for easier identification. Use Alt+A to toggle between displaying actual names and aliases.

### Search and Filtering

**Q: How do I search for pools with any DOWN members?**

Type "down" in the search box. This will show pools that either have DOWN status themselves or contain members with DOWN status.

**Q: How do I find pools that need attention?**

Type "changed" in the search box, click the "Changed" button, or press Alt+C. This shows pools with unacknowledged status changes (pulsing badges).

**Q: What's the difference between "web app" and "web AND app" in search?**

"web app" (without quotes) searches for pools containing "web" OR "app". "web AND app" requires both terms to be present. Use quotes for exact phrases: "web app".

### Status Change Tracking

**Q: Why are some status badges pulsing?**

Pulsing indicates that a pool member's status has changed from its initially recorded baseline state. Click the pulsing badge to acknowledge the change and stop the pulsing.

**Q: What happens if I don't acknowledge status changes?**

The pulsing will continue until you either click to acknowledge, use the "Reset" button, or the member returns to its baseline state automatically.

**Q: Can I see a history of status changes?**

Yes, enable the logger (Alt+L) to see real-time status changes with timestamps. The logger maintains a history of changes for your current session.

### DNS Features

**Q: Why do some pools show hostnames and others show IP addresses?**

The dashboard uses DNS resolution when configured. If a hostname can be resolved for a pool member, it displays the hostname. Otherwise, it shows the IP address. You can hover over hostnames to see the underlying IP address.

**Q: How do I update hostnames after DNS changes?**

Press Alt+R or click the "Resolve" button to force fresh DNS resolution. Press Alt+F or click "Flush" to clear the DNS cache completely.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does my browser tab stay active even when I'm not looking at it?**

When the logger is visible, the dashboard uses Wake Lock technology to prevent your browser tab from going to sleep. This ensures continuous monitoring and logging. The wake lock is released when you hide the logger. Wake-lock may not be available on all client systems.

**Q: How much data does the dashboard use?**

Data usage is minimal. Each refresh fetches only JSON data (typically just a few KB per site). The amount depends on the number of pools and members configured for the site you are monitoring.

**Q: Is there a maximum number of pools the dashboard can display?**

There's no hard limit, but performance may decrease with very large numbers of pools (1000+). Use search filtering and MICRO view to manage large pool sets effectively.
